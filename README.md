# FoodAndNon-food
 - This project use Transfer Learning with pre-trained model VGG16 with ImageNet - 1.000.000 images and 1000 weights with 16 layers.
 - The project purpose is to compare the differnces between using augmentation and without using agumentation.
 - We can see, with aumentation, it takes about 5 minutes to finish 1 batch even though I have freeze the parameters
 - On the other hand, it spend 00.605822 seconds completing one batch when augmentation has not been used.
